            KN Store was born from a simple belief: that beauty is not vanity, but an act of self-care.
            We curate only what we would use ourselves — products that honor your skin, your time, and your ritual.
          </p>
          <p className="body-lg text-text-muted">
            Every product in our collection is chosen for its efficacy, its ingredients, and its ability
            to transform a routine into a moment of calm in a busy world.
